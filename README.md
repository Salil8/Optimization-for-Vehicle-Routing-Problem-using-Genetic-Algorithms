# Vehicle Routing Problem Solver and Maze Solver using Genetic Algorithms

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and a Maze Solver using genetic algorithms implemented with the DEAP library in Python on Google Colab.

## Overview

The project includes implementations of genetic algorithms (GAs) to solve two distinct problems:
- **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**: Optimizes routing solutions for efficient logistics management.
- **Maze Solver**: Finds optimal paths through mazes using GA techniques.

## Files

- `Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problem using Genetic Algorithms.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for solving VRP with genetic algorithms on Google Colab.
- `Genetic_Algos_Maze_Solver.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for solving maze problems with genetic algorithms on Google Colab.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Access the notebooks:
   - Open `Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problem using Genetic Algorithms.ipynb` on Google Colab to explore VRP solutions.
   - Open `Genetic_Algos_Maze_Solver.ipynb` on Google Colab to explore maze solving using GAs.

## Requirements

- Google Colab account
- Internet connection
